# BookBlend (css-frameworks-ca)

For this project I was tasked to create a social media application and I could choose the design and the topic. I chose to create a page for book lovers and named it BookBlend. This is a social media application for all the book lovers who want to share their passion and thoughts on books.

## Description

This was the first project where we were tasked to use Bootstrap and SASS. I started off with a rough wireframe and noted down colours, then got started on the "bones" in HTML and then I added everything Bootstrap and SASS has to offer to make this site liked I imagined.

## Brief
